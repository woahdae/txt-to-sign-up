A little sinatra app to run on Heroku that takes Twillio messages and
records them to a Goodle Sheet.

Note, you need to add [this tiny buildpack](https://github.com/woahdae/env-to-config-buildpack)
to set up auth for google sheets.

If you find this and want more documentation, it could certainly use it,
so PM me and I'll flush it out.
